Arrays:

An array struct in Swift is:

```
let variableName: [TypeOfTheData]  = [1, 2, 3]
```

You can use something called '.count' to find out how many elements your array has, by putting on your code like:

```
variableName.count
```

You can consulte the values on your array by putting this in your code:

```
variableName[0]
```
